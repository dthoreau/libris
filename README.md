meis libris (my books)

Highly likely to be re-written to use python and fastapi in multiple microservices

A personal library manager, in perl, Go, and what ever else I feel like.

Not remotely feature complete. In fact, missing some very key features. Like form handling.

Currently in mid-migration from (incomplete) perl to microservice based.
