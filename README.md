meis libris (my books)

An in-progress construction of a library management system.

Currently being re-witten as a FastAPI microservice, with Starlette as a frontend

Todo list:
- Extend Starlette to allow related sections
- Improve all calls to show related items
  - Author Books is done, as an example
- Render books as a citation
- User tracking / login (OAuth?)
- Create user collections, locations to allow for local library tracking
